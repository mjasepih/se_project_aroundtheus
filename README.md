## Summary
This project was created utilizing a Figma brief provided by my schooling program (listed below). It is based around familiarizing yourself with creating a responsive web design. It implements grid, flexbox, and other great techniques to make this an easier and more seamless process. Check it out on GitHub Pages - [https://mjasepih.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/](https://mjasepih.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/)
